# Tim Hortons Recommendation System

Production-style recommendation system inspired by large-scale architectures used at Netflix, Amazon and TikTok.

This project implements a **two-stage recommendation pipeline**:

1. Candidate Retrieval (Two-Tower Model)
2. Ranking Model for Top-K recommendations

The system simulates how real-world recommendation systems operate in production ML environments.

# Model Design

## Two-Tower Retrieval

Two separate neural networks learn embeddings for:

- Users
- Products

User Tower → User Embedding  
Item Tower → Item Embedding  

Similarity(User, Item)

Top-K similar products are selected as candidate items.

---

# Ranking Model

A neural ranking model re-scores the candidates.

Input features:

- user features
- item features
- interaction features

Output:

ranking score

Top scoring items become final recommendations.

---

# Evaluation Metrics

Offline evaluation includes:

- Recall@K
- Precision@K
- NDCG@K

Example:

Recall@10 = 0.34

---

# API Example

Start API:

python api/app.py

Request:

http://localhost:5000/recommend?user_id=1

Response:

{
"user_id":1,
"recommendations":["Coffee","Ice Capp","Bagel"]
}

# Future Improvements

Possible production extensions:

- Spark feature engineering
- Databricks training pipeline
- FAISS vector search
- Real-time user events
- A/B testing

## Distributed Data Pipeline

The project includes a Spark-based feature engineering pipeline to simulate
large-scale recommendation data processing used in modern ML platforms
such as Databricks.

Pipeline:

User Events
→ Spark Feature Engineering
→ Two-Tower Retrieval
→ Ranking Model
→ API Serving
